**POST QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY** 
**A brief survey of classical cryptosystems, their fallacy and the advent of post-quantum cryptography with the deep insight into hashed based signature scheme**

*Abstract:*

Cryptography is the art of writing secret text. Employing Cryptography the human-readable text is converted into a Ciphertext(coded text) by the means of some consistent algorithm. The essence of a good Cryptosystem lies in consistent and easy to understand Encryption and Decryption algorithms. Before the advent of Quantum computers, much of the cryptographic algorithms depend on the principles of number theory, abstract algebra, and probability theory mainly Factorization Problem and Discrete Logarithmic problems. With the advancements in the field of quantum computing, the classical cryptosystems are no longer secure and it poses a threat to global security. In this brief survey, we would look towards some of the prime classical cryptosystems, their fallacy, and the advancement of the post-quantum cryptography, especially of the Hashed based Signature Scheme. The review also looks towards the difference between Post Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Cryptography.
